# Community

This project is the issue tracker for MayaData community projects like proposals of blog posts for the MayaData or OpenEBS blog to be written by community writers.

All issues labeled with "up-for-grabs" can be taken by the community. If you have a new proposal, you're welcome to create a new issue.

For an overview on the content writers program please visit [content-writers.md](./content-writers.md)
